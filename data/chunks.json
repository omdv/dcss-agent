["Kiting is a basic tactic used to kill monsters while avoiding engaging in melee.\nUseful Info\n\nKiting involves running away from a monster, before it can attack you, in order to gain some advantage:\n\n    Speed/Distance: If you are faster than a monster, then you'll gain distance as you run away. Combine that with a form of ranged or reaching attack, and you can damage (eventually kill) melee monsters with 100% safety. Back away from the monster whenever it gets close to you; when you are far enough away, hit it with a ranged or reaching attack. Repeat until the monster is dead.\n\n    If you have some other means of creating distance, you can use that to kite. You can hop between different sets of stairs to create distance, thus allowing you to kite same-speed foes. Or you can use effects like Passage of Golubria and Borgnjor's Vile Clutch in a similar way.\n\n    Damage over time: Kiting can be used with damage over time effects, such as poison, Sticky Flame, or Freezing Cloud. For example, you can inflict poison, retreat a few tiles, and repeat. Without a means of creating distance, you can't kite indefinitely, but you can still inflict significant damage.\n    Regeneration: If you miscast Magic Dart, you've used up 1 MP. So long as you aren't in melee range yet, you can back off, recover that 1 MP, and try to fight again.\n\nNotes\n\n    Before kiting, make sure you actually have room to back up.\n        Kiting is related to pillar dancing; a large \"pillar\" lets you kite enemies in a circle. If the pillar has an irregular shape, the enemy may forget about you, allowing you to reengage with more ranged attacks.\n    If you aren't faster than the monster, you should always keep at least 1 tile of distance away, to avoid attacks of opportunity.\n    It's best to kite around a reasonably known area. If you kite with unexplored area nearby, new monsters can show up, which can make kiting impossible. E.g. you won't be kiting a hydra when a torpor snail is slowing you down.\n    You can also kite ranged enemies that are slower than you. Enemies cannot attack you from outside your LOS. So long as you keep the enemy at the edge of LOS, and have space to retreat, you'll have the", " option to back off. This forces the enemy outside LOS, thus forcing it to move (and not attack).\n", "This is a collection of random tips and tricks for those who are starting to play Dungeon Crawl.\nContents\n\n    1 General\n    2 Monsters\n    3 Items\n    4 Spells\n    5 Miscellaneous\n    6 Fighting Strategies\n        6.1 If There is a Monster in View\n        6.2 If There is no Monster in View\n\nGeneral\n\n    Don't forget that Dungeon Crawl is a turn-based game; monsters won't act until after you do. If the situation grows dire, stop and think about every aspect before picking a solution and making your move. Indeed, you can even save your game and leave the computer to do something else, then come back later -- some time to calm down and think can often let you salvage a situation that originally looked hopeless. You may have a brilliant idea that you wouldn't have had in the heat of the moment!\n        Note that \"remembering stuff\" costs no game time; this includes looking through your inventory ('i' command), your spells ('z' command followed by '?'), your abilities ('a' command), your maps of the dungeon ('X' command), and using 'ctrl+f' to search for (but not travel to) known items in the dungeon. Note that within the 'X' command, you can use '[' and ']' to switch levels -- to descend into a branch, put the cursor on its entry stair before using ']'.\n    You do not have to fight and kill all monsters now (or ever). In roguelike games such as Dungeon Crawl, there is no guarantee that you'll be able to overcome all the challenges you meet, and escaping or ignoring some monsters or branches for the moment is a perfectly valid strategy. Remember, your goal is to survive.\n    While it's best to specialize early on and invest all your XP into a couple of skills to ensure you've got some reliable means of surviving, as the game progresses you should diversify your skills to ensure you can meet any challenge.\n        Melee fighters might want to learn Spellcasting and dabble in magic, even if its just with Evocations.\n        Spellcasters will want to invest some XP into Fighting, Dodging, and perhaps Armour and/or Shields.\n        Don't forget about Invocations and Evocations either, depending on your god choice or equipment.\n    Early game potion and scroll identification is straightforward for a couple of common items; potions of curing and scrolls of identify", " are the most common of their type. However, the next most common scroll, the scroll of teleportation, could be troublesome in an uncleared level. You can view item rarity with the \\ key (- to see unidentified items).\n    Knowing which dungeon branches you should tackle, and in what order, will make your game smooth and your progress quick. See the Walkthrough for more information.\n    If you haven't won yet, stick with the basic 3 rune game. As you gain skill, start exploring the optional endgame branches.\n\nMonsters\n\n    Do your best to learn every monster's strengths and weaknesses, behaviour, and pattern of attack. All such information can be found right here on this wiki! Another resource are the Knowledge Bots available in Crawl servers, IRC or the official Crawl website.\n    Whenever possible, fight in corridors that are one tile wide to avoid being surrounded by monsters. If there isn't a convenient corridor, you can use a wand of digging to create one. If you use ranged abilities or spells and miss your first target, you even have a chance of hitting the monsters lined up behind it! Doorways are another option, although intelligent monsters will move past you to give their companions a shot at mauling you.\n    If neither are available, you can fight on a staircase leading to the previous level. When a monster moves next to you, it will follow you if you go upstairs: you can break up groups of monsters and kill them one by one this way.\n    To \"pull\" single monsters while avoiding their neighbours, shoot them with missiles (such as stones) or with a single target spell like Magic Dart. Yelling (tt) should only be used when you want to wake all nearby creatures, including nearby ones out of sight. Keep in mind that many monsters may make noise if they either get hit or spot you, possibly waking up other monsters nearby.\n    Some monsters avoid known traps; you can therefore take shelter behind a trap and kill these creatures with missiles or spells. Likewise, many monsters avoid damaging areas such as clouds of miasma or noxious fumes created by spells like Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot and Mephitic Cloud. On the other hand, mindless and high level monsters will walk into traps and clouds to get to you; you can exploit this advantage by standing next to a cloud of flame, for example, and letting a zombie toast itself trying to get to you.\n", "    Known teleport traps and shafts can become an emergency means of escape. Step on them to escape a horde of enemies, or trick a tough monster into stepping on them to get rid of them for a while.\n\nItems\n\n    Many items can be identified by trying them out. You can read tips about identifying items this way here. Also, when looking at inventory or stack lists, notice the color items are displayed in, as this can tell you things your character knows but the player might not:\n\nDark Grey\n    Item is currently unusable\nLight Grey\n    Item is unidentified, or is a standard identified item\nBlue\n    Item is unidentified and magical\nBright Green\n    Item is equipped\nWhite\n    Item is a random artefact\nBright Red\n    Item is generally harmful to use\nRed\n    Item is hated by your god\nPurple\n    Item is potentially dangerous to use (will warn you if you try to use it)\nYellow\n    Item is beneficial\nLight Blue\n    Item is highly beneficial, or an unrand artefact\n\n    You won't be able to carry every worthwhile item you come across, since you're limited to 52 types of items in your inventory. Keep in mind that you can use (ctrl+f) to look for items if you're not sure exactly where you left them. Some players might want to create a centralized stash at a known location.\n    A scroll of blinking is the most reliable means of escape for characters early on. Use them wisely to avoid death.\n    A scroll of teleportation can also be used to escape, but is riskier - especially if you're on a level you haven't fully explored. It beats a guaranteed chance of death; but as it takes some time to activate, make sure its not guaranteed next turn.\n\nSpells\n\n    Mephitic Cloud is one of the best tools at your disposal. Any monster not resistant to poison can be confused via this spell. While in their confused state, monsters will move and attack randomly, and may even damage themselves or their friends!\n    In emergencies, you can use the Sublimation of Blood spell to restore MP if you have a high Necromancy skill and enough HP to spare.\n    Blink can be a lifesaver if you get into a jam and need to run away, especially if you're a slow species. Keep in mind that, unlike with a scroll of blinking, you don't get to pick your destination,", " so you could blink towards trouble.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n    Each regular level has 3 non-hatch staircases down and 3 staircases up, barring the top and bottom of a branch (which may contain an entrance to another branch). When you see fewer staircases, you know the level is not fully explored yet. The opposite may not be true: just because you see 6 staircases does not mean the level is fully explored. Missing stairs might only be accessible by going through an adjacent level -- some levels are split into multiple disconnected sections, and those sections need not be connected.\n    If you're going to stand in one spot for an extremely long period of time -- say, while recovering HP or waiting for a status to time out -- do so on a stairway so you can escape if something dangerous approaches.\n    Escape hatches are special one-way staircases that lead you either up or down a floor. They always go to the same spot, but there's no guarantee that a staircase leading back will be anywhere near a hatch's landing point. There's almost never any risk in taking an escape hatch that leads upwards, and can create shortcuts now, or when you've got the Orb of Zot. But taking an escape hatch downwards can be risky, especially if it leads to the bottom floor of a branch.\n\nFighting Strategies\n\nWhether your character is a melee fighter or a spellcaster, you can use the tactics described below.\nIf There is a Monster in View\n\n    If the monster cannot move (like a statue or an oklob plant), leave it be and return to kill it once you have cleared the level, assuming you have the tools to do so. If you're not equipped to fight it, just leave.\n    If it is a hydra, switch to a flaming, ranged, or non-edged weapon, then proceed as usual (this does not apply to undead hydras -- you may safely use edged weapons on them). If it is a shapeshifter pretending to be a hydra, you may want to wait until it changes form or force it to change form with a wand of polymorph.\n    If it is attacking you with an element you don't currently resist but can with appropriate randart weapons or rings, wield/put on that item. Do not switch other equipment (especially body armour), since this will take many turns during which the monster can attack you freely!\n    If there is an extremely dangerous monster in view, you may", " want to kill it as soon as possible, even if it is part of a larger group. If that would be too dangerous, run, teleport or blink away. Dangerous monsters include:\n        Paralyzing monsters, such as floating eyes\n        Monsters who can summon fiends, such as dread liches and Pandemonium lords\n        Tormenting monsters (which remove 35-50% of your HP with a single hit unless you are immune to torment) such as fiends, curse skulls, curse toes, mummy priests, royal mummies, and tormentors.\n        Monsters who can cast Lehudib's Crystal Spear, such as deep elf/draconian annihilators, wizards, and ancient liches.\n        Mutating monsters: neqoxecs, shining eyes, orbs of fire, and Mnoleg.\n        Monsters who attack you using an element you aren't resistant to\n        Smiting monsters, such as orc priests and smoke demons\n        Unique monsters\n    If there are several monsters, retreat to a chokepoint.\n    If you get swamped by summoned monsters, go up the stairs. Failing that, try to kill the summoner first, since that will get rid of all their summons.\n    If it has a ranged attack, either run up to it to force it into melee or run for cover behind a corner, whichever is faster.\n    If your character's life is at risk, read Escaping from (and avoiding) trouble.\n    Once all monsters are dead, check any equipment they dropped. ctrl+F will show all items of a type; inputting '.' will show all items on the floor.\n\nIf There is no Monster in View\n\n    If you are hurt (and not a Meteoran), rest by holding Shift and pressing '5' on the NumPad until your HP or MP is full. Consumables should generally be saved for emergencies.\n    If you are not on a special level, press 'o' to auto-explore.\n    If you are on a special level, carefully explore manually in circles from the upstairs until fully cleared and explored. Consider using a scroll of magic mapping if you know there's a dangerous vault somewhere (like in the bottom floor of a branch).\n    If you are done exploring the current level, follow the walkthrough for the next steps (which will often be to just continue down, but be careful not to enter branch ends earlier than you should).\n", "This guide gives general character building advice for the early game. Early game generally ends when you've reached the latest Ecumenical Temple spawn level, Dungeon level 7. However, many of these points still apply when taking on the later Dungeon and Lair.\nContents\n\n    1 Build a Basic Plan\n        1.1 Beginning\n        1.2 Defenses\n        1.3 A note on hybrids\n        1.4 Auxiliary Skills\n    2 Stats\n        2.1 Strength\n        2.2 Intelligence\n        2.3 Dexterity\n    3 Gods\n    4 Skills by background\n        4.1 Warriors\n        4.2 Zealots\n        4.3 Hybrids\n        4.4 Mages\n        4.5 Adventurer\n    5 Weapons\n    6 Armour\n\nBuild a Basic Plan\n\nThis guide assumes that you are using manual skill training. Life gets much easier for characters who focus on just a few skills while getting started. You can press m to view your skills menu, and then use the / key to swap between automatic and manual.\nBeginning\n\nAt the very start, focus on your primary killing skills. If you can't reliably kill things, a few extra turns of survival don't mean much. Melee accuracy and magic success rates are naturally low, and thus, important to raise.\n\nFor melee characters, this involves raising your weapon skill until it can kills your foes at a 'comfortable' rate. How much is comfortable?\n\n    There is an important threshold at (base delay - 1.0) * 20 skill. This is the skill required to consistently swing at 1.0 turn, assuming you don't have a shield (as opposed to 1.1 or 1.5 turn). That's 6 skill for hand axes, 10 skill for war axes, etc.\n    Your ultimate goal is to hit a weapon's minimum delay, i.e. where no more training can increase your swing speed. You can view this by selecting the weapon in the inventory. But, while it is certainly possible to only train your weapon until you hit mindelay, you may not want to do this. (Skills get more expensive as you level up; e.g. 10 -> 14 Axes could mean 0 -> 10 Fighting.)\n\nFor magic-based characters, this is getting the useful spells in your starting", " book to acceptably low - at least less than 10% - failure rates by training their respective spell schools. Depending on your class, it may require training towards a level 2 spell (like Scorch) or level 3 (such as Frozen Ramparts). More details below.\n\nHow much you want to micromanage it is up to you. You may want to keep your weapon skill as your only skill until you hit 1.0 delay.\nDefenses\n\nThe most logical step after training offense, is to train your defense. Again, you'll want to reach 'comfortable' numbers in that field. But if your offense starts to become lacking again, remember to start training that again. If you aren't into micromanagement, you can just train both at the same time at this point.\n\nFirst comes your HP. The Fighting skill is a must for any character; not only is the bonus to physical combat useful, but the extra HP is precious, especially for squishier caster types. After all, you don't want your Felid to get one-shot by an orc priest's Smiting. A regular character doesn't want to risk a two-shot, either. You probably don't want to risk melting to any other monster, really.\n\nFor those wearing light armour like robes or leather armour, your (next) primary defense is likely going to be Dodging, which contributes towards EV. For those in heavier armour like chain mail or plate mail, the Armour skill, which boosts your equipment's AC bonus, is more helpful. Read more below on which sets of body armour you should wear in the first place.\n\nShields provide an EV-like boost to your defenses, allowing you a chance to block some incoming attacks. Shields are especially useful for species with body armour issues like Trolls and Octopodes. For as long as you can still attack at a sane delay (< 1.0 deca-aut) or cast your spells at a reasonable rate (< 10% failure), you should be fine on all things shield related.\nA note on hybrids\n\nEven if you are aiming to be a \"hybrid\", don't try training both your magic and your melee at the same time. Having a single highly effective method of killing enemies is better than having two mediocre ones.\nAuxiliary Skills\n\nDuring the very early game, skills like Evocations won't be very useful. A strong wand, like a wand of paralysis, works well enough on D", ":3 with 0 Evocations. However, they are eventually worth investing into. Characters a bit deeper in the Dungeon can afford to train it a little. Five (5) Evocations is enough for now -- save further investment for when you get your main offensive skill up and running.\n\nDon't worry about Invocations early on. Most gods have 1* abilities that don't require much training to be reliably invoked.\n\nA small amount of Throwing (~2 points) is perfectly fine at this stage to boost the accuracy of darts or the damage of blunt weapons. However, their relative scarcity makes them unable to pull weight on their own.\n\nA little bit of Stealth (about 5-8 at first) is useful for any character currently wearing light armour, assuming you have a great aptitude for it. Species with low HP, like Vine Stalkers, Deep Elves, and Spriggans will especially benefit from being able to avoid fights with dangerous foes. Species with plain aptitudes can instead get 2-3 points, more so to avoid enemies than to take them down.\nStats\n\nIn addition to occasionally gaining stats as you level up, your character gets two stat points of your choice every 6 levels. Where you put these in the early game depends on your character and often your plans for their future. Stat zero will eventually be a valid concern for some starting character combinations, but you don't need to worry about it yet.\nStrength\n\nStrength increases most physical damage (everything not boosted by Dex) and alleviates some of the penalties of wearing armour. A strong choice for any physical attacker, especially those who (will) wear heavy armour.\nIntelligence\n\nIntelligence improves your spell success rate and spellpower. Spellcasters should almost always use their stat points to get more intelligence.\nDexterity\n\nDexterity improves a variety of defensive stats, like evasion, shields, and stealth. It also boosts the power of swords (Short Blades and Long Blades) and ranged weapons. For stabbers in particular, it'll improve your chances of landing a \"stab\" while unseen/unnoticed.\nGods\n\nMain article: Choosing a god\n\nSome backgrounds begin worshiping a god, but characters without one should consider who to initially worship.\n\nGods found on the earliest floors on the Dungeon -- D:2 and D:3 -- automatically deserve some merit. Worshipping an early god means you'll get more piety, which means you'll get a helpful ability earlier,", " which means you'll be more likely to survive.\n\nBut for simple choices, Okawaru is great for melee-focused characters, while Vehumet boosts the destructive potential of casters. The choosing a god article has much more detail on everyone else.\nSkills by background\n\nIn the early game, preferred skills are directly based on the character's background, with a few variations due to species.\nWarriors\n\nWhether ranged or hand to hand, Warriors kill by using weapons or unarmed combat.\n\nIn order to deal as much damage as quickly as possible, all warriors should focus on training their primary weapon skill. As a rule of thumb, they should improve the weapon skill to at least 1.0 delay. After that, begin to branch out into Fighting, Throwing, Armour, or Shields depending on class and character design, but always leave weapon skill turned on during the early game.\n\nIt can be argued that you should delay your weapon training, in case you find a good weapon of another type. However, you want said skill threshold at a minimum, so you aren't stuck hitting monsters with a 0 skill weapon.\nZealots\n\nLike the warrior classes, by far the main focus is to improve weapon skill. Cinder Acolytes can also invest a little in magic, but Scorch alone can only go so far.\nHybrids\n\nShapeshifters have more complex initial skilling than usual. They should start by training Unarmed Combat and later train Shapeshifting to gain access to Flux Form. However, with a great early weapon, it may be advisable to start training that weapon's skill instead.\n\nEnchanters should train Hexes and a little Ice Magic to increase the effectiveness of Ensorcelled Hibernation and Confusing Touch. Once your Hexes have enough power to reliably mess up your enemies, you should pour some XP into Stealth and Short Blades.\n\nWarpers and Hexslingers should focus on improving their weapon skill. The former can then invest in getting Blink reliably castable, while the latter can boost the spellpower of Slow and later Cause Fear with Hexes training.\n\nReavers should start by training their weapon skill, as they are essentially melee warriors with a few situational spells. However, if you find an early book with useful Conjurations spells (e.g. Book of Conjurations), it may be worthwhile to train for those spells.\nMages\n\nFor almost all mages, the actual Spellcasting skill is not particularly", " important in the early game. It is much more important to get your offensive spells running, so casters should turn off all skills other than the necessary magic schools. Use 'I' often to check how easily you can cast your important spells. After failure rates for your critical combat spells are less than 10%, branching out into spellcasting, defenses, and other magic schools becomes appropriate.\n\nA small exception to this are spriggan spellcasters. Spriggans can use their considerable speed to escape almost anything in the early dungeon, so mere survival is not the necessarily first objective - consider Fighting to raise your measly HP.\n\n    Hedge Wizards and Alchemists should focus on getting their low level attack spell(s) and Mephitic Cloud to <10% failure rates. Two or three points into out-of-the-way schools (Conjuration for Al, Alchemy for HW, Air for both) are useful. These classes, particularly Alchemists, may wish to branch into a weapon so they can kill confused low-level enemies more effectively.\n        Alchemist: Alchemy's early spells and skill levels are quite cheap, and are often worth it for their boost for survival and early game offense. Sting conserves more MP early on, but Mercury Vapours' smite-targeted weakening effect becomes more useful as you gain more MP.\n    Conjurers can focus almost entirely on Conjurations. Searing Ray gives you good killing power in the early game and works wonders in corridors; packs of jackals, gnolls or orcs will succumb to it quickly. The Alchemy skill is also used for Fulminant Prism, which deals great damage to nearby monsters after 20 auts.\n    Fire Elementalists want to get Scorch up very quickly -- Foxfire lacks effectiveness in the many, many hallways of the dungeon. Then, your next (and lesser) priority should be to get to Flame Wave.\n    Earth Elementalists should, in a similar vein, get Stone Arrow for a quick-casting attack spell. Sandblast deals good damage, but its slow attack speed is an issue with stronger monsters.\n    Ice Elementalists should try and get Frozen Ramparts, which deals high and 100% accurate passive damage, as soon as possible.\n    Summoners hit another key level 3 spell with Call Canine Familiar.\n    Air Elementalists are fine with their level 1 and 2 spells, offensively. However, both Swiftn", "ess and Airstrike will be useful to have later down the road.\n    Necromancers can focus on their spells, though they have a shorter shelf life than most. If the character wants to dabble in melee, branch out to a weapon skill. If you (plan to) worship Kiku, Short Blades are good option, recieving the most benefit from the pain brand. Otherwise, Polearms can reach through your undead slaves, while a staff of death can justify investing into Staves.\n\nAdventurer\n\nArtificers should focus on a weapon they find (a club is not worth training for), as their wands will have respectable power against early Dungeon monsters even at their starting Evocations skill.\n\nWanderers should wing it. Take a look at your early possessions and try to make a plan based on what you've got available.\n\nDelvers can either focus on Stealth, until they make it up to D:2, or just start by focusing on a weapon.\nWeapons\n\nIn the early dungeon, most characters will find wielding a one-handed weapon with good accuracy to be more effective than trying to hit anything with a large, but slow weapon. Daggers and whips often have good brands on them, while slings are universally effective in the hands of any character that can find them.\n\nOnce you have started training a particular weapon skill, you should usually favour weapons of that skill unless you find something incredible that makes the switch pay off.\nArmour\n\nSpell-using characters should avoid wearing anything heavier than leather in the early game. Ring mail and bucklers may seem dandy, but in the early game, the greatest defense is killing your foe reliably and fast. Once you can cast your spells more reliably, you can consider upgrading to somewhat heavier armour.\n\nMelee builds are typically spell-less right now, and should equip the heaviest armour and shield they can wear without seriously affecting their damage output.\n", "Characters in the midgame will have found a god, but have not entered the two rune-containing Lair branches yet. From now on, your skills no longer reflect your background, but rather reflect your general strategy, species, and god choice.\nContents\n\n    1 Armour Focused\n        1.1 Weapon\n        1.2 Range\n        1.3 Defense\n        1.4 Spells\n    2 Range Focused\n        2.1 Weapons\n        2.2 Spellcasting\n        2.3 Spell Schools\n        2.4 Defense\n        2.5 Auxiliary\n    3 Invocations\n    4 Footnote\n\nArmour Focused\n\nWhile nearly all players should consider some spells (barring Trog-lodytes), melee focused players tend to wear heavier armour, and will be stuck to casting low level spells as a result.\nWeapon\n\nYour weapon school should still be, by far, your most important skill. As stated in the early-game section, your goal is to reach minimum delay for your weapon. Viewable by selecting the weapon in the inventory, the minimum delay is 0.5 to 0.7 decaAut, taking anywhere from 10 to 24 levels. Raising your weapon skill beyond mindelay will still raise damage and accuracy, though it will no longer increase swing speed. Its unlikely for you to reach it in a timely manner for especially big weapons, such as giant clubs or triple swords, but you should keep training.\n\nWarriors need to make a choice: how many hands will you dedicate? Two-handed weapons deal more damage... but take more investment and restrict your shield slot. Of course, you still need a reasonable delay to even consider a two-hander (or a big shield).\nRange\n\nMelee fighters have a big weakness -- they have to fight in melee. Diverting some experience into ranged weaponry can help even things out. Throwing is an obvious choice; it doesn't require you to wield another weapon and isn't slowed by heavy armour. Ten (10) skill is useful to get the penetrating javelins to 1.0 delay. Okawaru can supply you with a surplus of throwing weapons, while the Shoals generates many merfolk javelineers to relinquish ammo from.\n\nEvocations is an interesting skill to train. Ranged attacks are best for enemies that are sketchy to fight honourably; and are what", " wands are best for. Even a wand of polymorph can neuter that scary orc warlord or unique! Anywhere from 5-12 skill into Evocations is often viable, especially if you generate the Swamp.\nDefense\n\nFighting still remains the most important defensive skill. HP is the only defense that can't be ignored, while the actual skill also boosts your combat prowess. Fighting is one of your most important skills, period -- especially once you've finished training up your weapon.\n\nYour other defensive skills - Armour, Dodging, and Shields - are simply less important, but still very useful. Armour should be above 10. Dodging might not be very useful to someone wearing a sluggish plate armour, but a few levels will be very cheap in comparison to your main skills. Shields, if you are wearing one, is also useful to train. Around 10+ for a kite shield or 15+ for a tower shield will suffice.\nSpells\n\nWith such heavy armour, high level spells are simply out of the question. Instead, look at the various utility spells in your arsenal. From Translocations like Blink, to Necromancy via Animate Dead, there are plenty of useful non-damaging spells. Getting these spells castable in heavy armour should be a tertiary focus, unless you plan to move to a lighter armour like fire dragon scales.\nRange Focused\n\nPlayers wearing light armour tend to be using ranged weapons or are spell-focused.\nWeapons\n\nCasters tend to use weapons to clean up lesser foes and deal with resisting enemies. Just as common, especially by the mid-game, is to use no weapon at all! Casters using weapons should not pour lots of experience into their weapon skill.\n\nHowever, one nice application is to invest in 12 Staves skill to get a matching magical staff up to mindelay. These deal respectable damage, with their damage scaling off your magic. Needless to say, don't do this if you're struggling at all with spells or defense.\n\nHexers also want some Short Blades skill in order to improve their stabbing. Mindelay (10-14 skill) is enough.\n\nRanged weapons fundamentally skill just like melee. Get to your mindelay, though since you have range, reaching 1.0 delay isn't as big as a factor.\nSpellcasting\n\nSpellcasting itself is a useful skill, though doesn't have the greatest impact for actually casting spells.\n\nIf you go into the skills menu (m) and cycle", " with (!), you can look at skill costs. Compared to other skills, Spellcasting only improves casting by a rate of 1/4. But if Spellcasting is (less than) 1/4 as expensive as a desired spell school, its worth it.\n\nCharacters running out of MP, should, of course, invest a couple more points into this skill. Once you get into level 5-6 spells, you can definitely afford to invest 10+ levels into this skill. The same applies for spell levels; though, make sure you really need this new spell, and can't just forget something with a scroll of amnesia.\nSpell Schools\n\nYou want to have your magical \"engine\" up and running as soon as possible. A reliable, heavily damaging, level 5-6 spell that can power through the Lair branches and Vaults, at the very least. Spells like Lee's Rapid Deconstruction and Plasma Beam fit the bill; Bombard and Orb of Destruction remain effective in the halls of Zot. Make sure these spells can be cast reliably (<10% failure).\n\nUnlike melee, spellpower remains fairly important for keeping spells competitive, so don't neglect to train even further. With a high aptitude (or when worshipping Vehumet), training even more skill will let you cast even higher level spells.\nDefense\n\nDefense is useful. Getting a nuclear spell up and running is more useful.\n\nOnce you get those spells ready, though, even spellcasters should invest in Fighting. This becomes more important after the Lair branches, when you start facing more ranged attacks and conjurations. You can leave Fighting trained the entire game, or just leave it in the upper teens. The same strategem also applies to Dodging, but with less levels - 8-10 will be useful.\n\nMost players will want a buckler (though most ranged weapons are 2-handed), and thus should choose to put a little (4) skill to offset some of the penalties. Upgrading to a larger shield is definitely possible, though always keep your main spell at a reliable casting rate. Ten (to 15) skill for a kite shield is probably enough; you don't want to put five more levels just to offset 2 EV. Magic training can improve failure rates even with insufficient Shields skill.\nAuxiliary\n\nSpells like Blink and Passage of Golubria are very useful, especially to a squishy caster. Sublimation of Blood relies a lot on spell", "power (i.e, a high Necromancy) to be effective, but will restore MP in a pinch.\n\nEvocations is less important than with a melee character, though still very helpful for dealing with tough enemies. A few levels is all you need for this task. Plus, a magical staff or an orb of energy both benefit a lot from this skill.\n\nFor offensive casters, stealth is only marginally useful. Many spells are loud, for one. And if you can obliterate your enemies from afar, who needs to hide? It's often easy to just run from a scary unique, as long as you have distance. Stealth does little to help your gameplan, though it does let you avoid encounters more easily.\n\nFor Hexers, or species with unusually high Stealth aptitude (Naga, Octopode...), Stealth is probably worth investing more into. Stealth improves stab damage. Many weaker species happen to have good stealth, and for them, avoiding ranged enemies is more important.\nInvocations\n\nNo matter if you are a brawler or a caster, you'll most likely have picked a god. Of course, some gods require more Inovcations than others.\n\n    Gods like Nemelex, Elyvilon, and Fedhas scale well with the Invocations skill, and their divine abilities can be used plenty of times. For them, Invocations can almost be treated like another (lesser!) weapon skill. Kiku replaces Invocations with Necromancy, so worshippers fall in the same boat.\n    Gods like Okawaru and Cheibriados do rely on Invocations, but more so to cast high-level abilities (Finesse / Duel and Slouch / Step from Time, respectively) than to boost damaging power. Get those abilities up and running in a timely manner, then don't worry about it. When training Invo, treat it like an auxiliary skill.\n    Finally, gods like Trog, Vehumet, and Gozag don't care about your Invocations. Just keep on working on your melee, magic, or greed, respectively.\n\nFootnote\n\nFrom the midgame onwards, exact skilling thresholds start to matter a lot less. It's ok to train many different skills at once, as long as you'd benefit in some way.\n", "This guide covers basic character build strategy for players that already have at least one rune, and are planning to get 3-4 runes before leaving with the Orb of Zot. This guide builds off what was covered in mid-game strategy.\n\nWrapping up our skills for our characters...\nContents\n\n    1 Melee Focused\n        1.1 Weapon\n        1.2 Defense\n        1.3 Range\n    2 Spell Focused\n        2.1 Weapon\n        2.2 Spellcasting\n        2.3 Spell Schools\n        2.4 Defense\n    3 Spell Choice\n        3.1 Choice by Armour\n            3.1.1 Light (Robe)\n            3.1.2 Mid (Dragon Scales)\n            3.1.3 Heavy (Plate)\n            3.1.4 Natural\n        3.2 Choice by category\n\nMelee Focused\n\nMelee focused players remain heavy armour, heavy damage, melee fighters.\nWeapon\n\nWeapon skill should go to all the way to your weapon's minimum delay, if you haven't reached it already. Most one-handers should already have reached mindelay, but the biggest weapons require more training:\n\n    24 for Executioner's axe, Bardiche, Giant spiked club\n    22 for Triple sword\n    20 for Great mace, Battleaxe, Glaive, Great sword\n\nEven past mindelay, you can choose to keep training. The fine-tuning doesn't really matter at this stage; you can keep skill at the mindelay threshold, or continue training up to the maximum of 27. Weapons with lower mindelays, like demon whips and eveningstars, will want at least a little more skill in order to improve their damage.\n\nBy now, many of the rarer weapons start to become available. Consult the weapon choice article for more details, though switching weapon schools by this stage is rarely a good idea. Regardless, Short Blades users should start considering swapping to Long Blades (or another weapon school). Stabbing an orb of fire is, too often, an impossible task.\nDefense\n\nIf you've been training up specific skills, your main defenses: Fighting, Armour, Dodging, and/or Shields might be lacking. Ideally, two of Armour, Dodging, and Shields should be at least ten, while Fighting still remains an important skill to train. Well before Zot", ", your fighting skill should surpass even your weapon skill in importance.\nRange\n\nThrowing, assuming you have plenty of javelins left, should be raised anywhere from 10, up to the javelin mindelay of 16. Don't throw them all the time, or they'll run out quick (unless you are worshipping Okawaru). Size matters; kobolds and spriggans can't use javelins, while trolls and ogres might want to train further to boost large rocks.\n\nThe same strategy applies to Evocations, but as they have no mindelay, you can choose to train them up to 27. A wand of acid and wand of iceblast remain great for the entire game, while hex wands still have plenty of weaker targets to disable. Many of the XP evocables, such as a condenser vane or tin of tremorstones, also have great effects when invested into.\n\nOnce again, consider low-level utility spells like Apportation, Blink, and Animate Dead. By now, getting the skill for them should be much more realistic. Unless you plan to go beyond a 3-5 rune game, attacking spells simply won't be useful.\nSpell Focused\n\nSpell focused characters focus their efforts on one or a few spells to do their deadly work.\nWeapon\n\nIf your character has extreme aptitudes for a weapon (+3 or +4), consider a melee focused end-game weapon. Otherwise, only bother with magical staves, one-handed weapons, or amazing unrands.\nSpellcasting\n\nSpell levels start to become more of an issue as they get more complex. By now, you can also freely train spellcasting in order to raise maximum MP.\nSpell Schools\n\nAssuming you've found a Zot viable spell, stick with that spell school. Think Bombard, Summon Horrible Things, Orb of Destruction, or pretty much any level 9 spell. However, level 9 spells are difficult to cast if you don't have amazing aptitudes or some form of wizardry.\n\nIf you haven't found one, you should be planning ahead to switch foci somewhere well before you approach a second rune. Whenever it'd be melee, range, or another spell school, you know you'll have to deal with ancient liches and orbs of fire in Zot:5.\n\nOnce you found that spell, you'll want as much spellpower as possible for your offensive spells. More reliable, more powerful, the better.\nDefense", "\n\nOnce you get your Zot-killing spell viable, your defenses should become a greater priority. Typically, you'll want to train Fighting and Dodging, as well as enough skill to cast while wearing a shield. All two-three skills should be raised above level 12 or so.\nSpell Choice\n\nBy this point in the game, the amount of experience you have is so high that the lines between melee focused players and spell focused players gets considerably blurred. Thus, it's easiest to divide spell choice by armour level and category.\nChoice by Armour\nLight (Robe)\n\nGoing with a robe, troll leather armour, or lighter dragon scales is the most common choice for spell-focused players. It's best for characters with no weapon or using a weapon only as emergency/clean-up. Any level of spell choice can be considered.\n\nHowever, 9th level spells are still an awkward choice for some species even in robes. Minotaurs and Trolls, for example, should not even consider casting them. Other players may choose not to bother, using lesser attack spells like Freezing Cloud and taking advantage of a wider variety of utility spells with the spare spell slots.\nMid (Dragon Scales)\n\nPlayers in fire dragon armour or heavier have generally foregone the thought of 9th level spells. Their highest level of offense is likely to be spells like Borgnjor's Vile Clutch, Bombard, and Orb of Destruction.\n\nThis is a choice best for those who either were formerly melee focused and now want some escape options, for those casters who don't wish to cast level 9 spells, or for those severely lacking in resists. Additionally, some species may be forced into it, with a lack of equipment options.\n\nFurthermore, this is not a permanent decision, and heavy dragon armour may be used temporarily before learning higher level spells.\nHeavy (Plate)\n\nPlate armour, as well as crystal plate armour and gold dragon scales, are the choice for those foregoing offensive magic altogether. Exceptions include worshippers of the god Cheibriados, the divine demigods, and those going past a 3-runer.\nNatural\n\nCertain Talismans will outright meld your armour with whatever your form provides. Statue Form, Dragon Form, and Storm Form all provide AC, HP, and/or EV. These transformations do not disrupt casting.\n\nCharacters training a lot of Shapeshifting may enjoy the benefit of a Death talisman, great for a 15-rune run, or simply closing", " out a 3-5 rune game. It does not meld any equipment slots, and provides interesting resistances and melee debuffs.\nChoice by category\n\nIf you choose to go with a 9th level spell, don't be picky: they are a massive investment in experience. You must have been training the school for most of the game to consider one. And unless you worship Vehumet -- and sometimes even then -- you might not get a 9th level spell reliable until you're just finishing your last rune. Don't try to focus on them; it won't help you survive with your problems now. Get your defenses and utility skill up, first.\n\nAll players relying mostly on magic for offense should learn a high level non-elemental damage spell for Zot. Lehudib's Crystal Spear, Orb of Destruction, Malign Gateway, and Dragon's Call (for summoners) are all good choices. Spellforged Servitor is extremely helpful, if it can cast another high level damaging spell to begin with.\n\nLow level spells start to become useless; physical options or Evocations are better for picking off foes.\n", "Sometimes, you can't win a fight, and sometimes the best thing to do is to run. Knowing when and how to escape a deadly situation is an essential part of playing Crawl. Crawl offers a number of escape options, as well as means of healing, disabling monsters, and many other things which just might save your life.\nContents\n\n    1 Avoiding Trouble\n    2 Options when in immediate danger\n        2.1 Potions (q)\n        2.2 Scrolls (r)\n        2.3 Quiver (Q)\n        2.4 Gods (a)\n        2.5 Escape Spells (z)\n            2.5.1 Translocations\n            2.5.2 Other Movement Spells\n            2.5.3 Disabling Tactics\n            2.5.4 Other\n    3 Escaping Trouble\n\nAvoiding Trouble\n\nThe best way to survive a troublesome predicament is keeping out of trouble in the first place. Let's see...\n\n    Don't move towards enemies. In unknown territory, anything could be there. You might find a single orc easy prey, but an orc priest can be waiting in the shadows. Even if it was a lone orc this time, there is always the risk of 2 priests being there. And if fighting Ijyb was bad enough, you could always be adding Sigmund to the mix.\n\n    Use those turns to reposition yourself, retreat into known territory, and/or use ranged attacks to soften up the enemy. Even at 0 Throwing skill, stones, boomerangs, and poisoned darts can do some damage.\n\n    When retreating, head towards known territory. It's often tempting to flee \"into the black\", directly away from the enemy. But, as mentioned above, you might find a dead-end or inconveniently placed monster. Retreat towards known areas, even if it means taking an extra hit or two. And make sure your route is actually safe - you don't want to be running away, only to come across even stronger enemies.\n\n    Explore only at full HP & MP. If a monster is dangerous when you have 100% HP, it's even more dangerous when you have 75% HP. By pressing the 5 key, you can wait until your HP/MP are full again. This consumes a lot of turns, but don't worry. Unless you're going for a high score, or", " really want to get into a timed portal, you win nothing by saving time.\n\n    Use tactical positioning. The layout of the Dungeon can be used to your advantage. For example, you can lead enemies into corridors in order to fight them one by one. That way, you avoid taking 8 hits at once! Even as a beefy axe user, being surrounded is a perilous situation.\n        Line of sight management: Enemies cannot target you for spells/attacks if they are outside your line of sight. Use this to your advantage against ranged foes. Take a corner as an example. You could charge directly into a centaur, giving it several turns to fire at you. Or, you can take 2 turns to duck behind a corner, wait for it to come to you, then step up into melee.\n\n    Watch out for noise. If an enemy hears noise, it will come to its location. Try to always be aware of noise. The less noise you make, the less likely you're going to be drawing in a monster mid-combat.\n\n    Noise, in a highly advantageous position, can be helpful. It can lure enemies in. You can bring packs into a corridor, or bring monsters to stair dance.\n\n    Skipping the floor is an option. You don't have to kill everything in Crawl. While it's usually good to clear each level, sometimes it isn't. Sigmund or a pack of orc priests are good reasons to skip D:2 or D:3, for instance. You can always come back later - when you have the items and experience to deal with it.\n\n    Specialize before you generalize. Make sure you can actually kill things with your skills of choice, before investing into others. Many troublesome situations can arise from not having enough \"kill power\" to fight basic enemies. If you have to blow a potion for every cane toad you see, you're gonna run out of consumables. Don't forget to put your non-killing skills once you have enough power (e.g. for a caster, train Fighting, Dodging, Stealth after getting spells to a low failure rate).\n\n    Triple visitation. Triple visitation means entering a level by all three staircases before you start exploring it in earnest. If you get into trouble, you may see a closer staircase to retreat to.\n        Note that this strategy is not without risks. Every time you go down an unknown stairs, there's a chance of instantly losing a game", " (say, being next to Sigmund or Grinder), or being put into an extremely dangerous situation. Therefore, this is best used on stealthy or swift characters.\n\nOptions when in immediate danger\n\nWhile its best to prevent danger, sometimes it is unavoidable. Whenever you get shafted, or see an out of depth monster, or a dangerous pack of monsters just after finishing a fight, you can find help with various escape options:\n\nThese are just some of the more useful, immediate tools at your disposal. Many more items might solve lethal situations. For example, a potion of might may give you the damage you need to handle a dangerous enemy. However, the Might status is not likely to help you when you are at low HP (beyond a last resort).\nPotions (q)\n\n    Potion of berserk rage: Hastes (and strengthens) you, and adds +50% temporary HP... but when it runs out, you will be slowed instead, and you won't be able to berserk again for a while! Mostly useful for killing things (thus precluding the need to escape in the first place), or sprint to a staircase a few (2-3) tiles away. Do not use berserk as a poor man's swiftness! You will be slowed much longer than the berserk will last.\n    Potion of ambrosia: Leaves you confused, but recovers both HP and MP as long as its confusion lasts. Useful when it'll be a few turns before the next monster comes, or if you need a quick MP heal.\n    Potion of curing: Heals a few HP and removes poison and confusion, which may be critical to end.\n    Potion of haste: Allows you to run away, though you will be susceptible to ranged attacks until you break LOS/leave the level. The speed boost has nice synergy with scrolls of fog, allowing you to quickly break LOS. Also allows for kiting tactics.\n    Potion of heal wounds: Heals approximately 25 HP (minimum 10 HP). In the early game, it is a significant boost, but slowly loses effectiveness throughout the game.\n\nScrolls (r)\n\n    Scroll of fog: Might help you cut line of sight from monsters that attack you from range. This can range from making a centaur get into melee range, to preventing an Ice Fiend from tormenting you during the orb run.\n    Scroll of fear: Helps in warding off packs or threats. It checks will", "power, so may not be successful against all monsters, but it may give you enough leeway to escape. Does not work against undead or nonliving creatures.\n    Scroll of silence: Prevent enemies (and you!) from casting both spells and godly abilities. Make sure to check them (xv) to make sure that silence can actually effect them! Very risky, but eases up many threats (such as Nikola or deep elves).\n    Scroll of teleportation: After a short delay of a few turns, translocates you to a random habitable square on the same level. This can be combined with other means of escape, then healing until teleport kicks in. Teleport early; if not to survive the delay, to survive if you get into another dangerous position (or even right next to where you were!). Beware of teleporting in unexplored levels, or where there is a dangerous vault (such as Elf:3 or the end of a rune branch).\n    Scroll of butterflies: Knocks enemies back and creates a mass of butterflies, which must be killed or move out of the way for enemies to attack you. Does not generate if a scroll of summoning is generated, and vice versa.\n    Scroll of blinking: Allows you to instantly translocate yourself to any visible square (transparent walls are treated as solid). Extremely powerful, a great \"jail out of free card\", but not infallible. See its page for when it doesn't work.\n\nQuiver (Q)\n\nIncludes wands (V) and throwables (F) (most other options may also be quivered).\n\n    Uncontrolled Blink: Instantly translocates you to a random blink-accessible square within line of sight. This can easily make the situation worse: imagine blinking from the edge of an orc pack to the center. But consider that you can blink from the center of an orc pack to the edge. LOS management is critical - for example, you can use a scroll of fog in conjunction so you can't see tiles near the enemy. Even stepping into a hallway can help your chances. In general, only use this if you can comfortably live wherever you land.\n    Paralysis/polymorph/Slow: Very effective in the early game, where few enemies can resist. Outside of the early game or Formicids, it's best to act early (or buff yourself). Sources include wands, curare darts, and the Hexes school of magic.\n   ", " Wand of iceblast, Wand of roots, Lightning Rod...: Attacks that can't miss, be shrugged off, or disabled. You run the risk of rolling low, but enemies with low HP will likely die.\n    Throwing net: Traps an enemy in a net, forcing them to waste turns breaking free. Even though spellcasters can still cast in a net, they often won't; monsters tend to \"move\" rather than cast.\n\nGods (a)\n\nAs you should expect, you won't get a god's abilities if you aren't worshipping the god in question.\n\n    Zin's Sanctuary: Protects you from nearly every attack, and scares away monsters. Combine it with other escape options, with healing, or use it near the stairs.\n    Lugonu's Enter the Abyss: Removes you from any situation immediately, leaving all pursuing monsters behind, but costs both HP and all of your MP. Keep in mind that you will then be in the Abyss, so it still might not \"save your life\".\n    Elyvilon's healing powers: More powerful than potions of heal wounds, but are limited by piety.\n    Cheibriados' Step from Time: Moves you to nowhere and lets time pass. During that time, monsters wander away and may even forget about you.\n    Dithmenos' Shadow Form: Transforms you into a shadow, which reduces damage taken by half, makes you invisible, and grants a few resistances.\n    Nemelex worshippers may draw upon their decks of escape. The tomb card can block any enemy not already close to you, the cloud card can act like a scroll of fog, and the elixir card can heal you. Combine with Triple Draw or Draw Four in order to get the most success.\n    Ru: All the abilities can be used in dicey situations; two are more obvious (Draw Out Power is a heal, Power Leap opens up a gap). Apocalypse is very loud, but deals massive damage and gives statuses to anything still alive.\n\nMany gods also have offensive abilities that can help in tough battles. It's better to use Okawaru's Finesse early than a scroll of blinking!\nEscape Spells (z)\nTranslocations\n\nTranslocations are designed in order to manipulate movement. Most of them can be used to solve some dicey situations, though some more than others.\n\n    Blink: Blinking can also be used to give you time to teleport: blink,", " activate a teleport and then start running away -- even if the monsters are faster than you, they can only gain one square a turn if you're running, giving teleport time to kick in. Has a cooldown unless at max power.\n    Passage of Golubria: Creates two portals, one targeted, and another just beside you. Limited to open enough areas, and at low spellpower, short distances. But even a single tile gap will let you reliably get away from monsters to climb the stairs. The portals last for a moderately long time, so you can cast PoG, run/teleport away, cast it again, and end up at your original destination. This spell can also teleport monsters, assuming they are willing to get into the portal.\n    Iskenderun's Mystic Blast / Dispersal: Both spells will force enemies away. IMB deals damage, is at a much more reasonable spell level, but has a chance to fail based on size. Meanwhile, Dispersal, if you succeed a willpower check, will cause a full teleport, but will always at least create a few tiles of distance.\n\nOther Movement Spells\n\n    Swiftness: Reduces your movement delay for a short time before slowing you, usually enough to get you to the stairs.\n    Passwall: A spell people love to underestimate (though for good reason -- waiting multiple turns is always risky). If you notice your trouble early enough, and know the map layout, it can create a lot of space in only 2-3 turns.\n\nDisabling Tactics\n\n    Cigotuvi's Dreadful Rot: Very situational spell. It creates a cloud of poisoning miasma on your tile, but temporarily drains your max HP. Since most early-game monsters won't enter the cloud, it can be used to block hallways. Can also use a potion of attraction to drag enemies into the miasma, dealing heavy poison damage and the slow status. Beware that undead and nonliving creatures are immune to miasma.\n    Hexes: Hex spells like Slow, Ensorcelled Hibernation, and Confusing Touch take a significant skill investment to be worth the turns and MP. A good option for Enchanters, who already use these spells for their day to day killing. Most of these allow a clean escape, and clean stabs.\n    Mephitic Cloud: Confuses foes, which is very effective when it works. Creatures with poison", " resistance are immune; monsters with 100+ HP will also often resist. Even without immunity, Mephitic cloud can be used against an adjacent enemy in most cases (aim at the *):\n\n.........  .........\n...###...  ....###..\n...#*#...  ....#*#..\n...##Y...  ....Y##..\n....@....  ....@....\n.........  .........\n\nAlso note that risking self-confusion is sometimes worth it. If worse comes to worst, you can always drink a potion of curing (which you might have been wanting to do anyway). Most enemies can't, and even humanoids are unlikely to be carrying more than one potion.\nOther\n\n    Summoning: Several summoning spells are great for defensive purposes even if they're useless for offense. You can exchange places with allies automatically, but an enemy will have to fight through or walk around them to get to you. This means that even a lowly rat can open up that vital one-square space for a stair escape!\n    Death's Door and Borgnjor's Revivification: high level, emergency Necromancy spells. Death's Door makes you invulnerable for a short time, but will leave you with very little HP. Borgnjor's Revivification restores your health to the maximum; at the cost of permanent maximum HP. Use these when you know you have to; and have the Necromancy to spare.\n\nEscaping Trouble\n\n    Prepare early. Once you know that a certain monster type or pack is dangerous, act like it's dangerous. Run before it gets melee, be ready to use consumables/god abilities quickly, etc.\n\n    Stair dance. \"Stair dancing\" is a tactic used to separate monsters. Since only adjacent monsters follow you up, stairs can be used to split groups of monsters.\n\n    There's a huge difference between \"fighting 2 orcs, resting, and fighting 3 orcs\", and \"fighting all 5 orcs at once\". Also, fighting a nasty monster on a \"cleared\" level is much less troublesome than an unknown one. On a cleared level, it's much less likely to encounter new monsters during the fight, and teleport becomes much more reliable as an escape option (teleporting on an unknown level can be nasty!)\n    Keep in mind that going up a stair takes 2.5 decaAut, meaning adjacent monsters will get 2 or even 3 attacks", " on you. Depending on the layout of the upstair, you may have to take extra attacks in order to get a better position.\n    Enemies with Blink (as rare as it is) can be left on the upstairs with little resource cost; lead them up, let them blink, and go back down. Leave them 2 levels just to be safe.\n\n    Use your abilities. When you're facing an emergency situation, slow down. Stop and think about every item and ability at your disposal. Often times players forget to use their spells, god abilities or even consumables when it matters the most. You can even save your game, ask for advice from other players and come back later!\n\n    Use marginal tools to non-marginal effect. Items like the scroll of noise or scroll of immolation are often pooh-poohed, yet they can save your life, or at least save you from using better consumables. Using that wand of paralysis early might mean saving a potion of heal wounds, scroll of blinking, etc. for another situation. Don't toss them until you're sailing smoothly... or even at all!\n\n    Engage fast monsters by stepping away. Fast monsters can get 2 turns for every 1 of your turns. If you wait, the enemy could get a free hit (move -> attack). Stepping away means they'll have to spend 2 turns moving towards you. In the case of bats, they won't have the chance to move away from you.\n"]
